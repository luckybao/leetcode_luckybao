Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.

For example, given the following triangle
[
     [2],
    [3,4],
   [6,5,7],
  [4,1,8,3]
]
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 11 (i.e., 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11).

Note:
Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(n) extra space, where n is the total number of rows in the triangle.

public class Solution {//using DP from bottom up, record on the way
//'Bottom-up' DP, on the other hand, is very straightforward: we start from the nodes on the bottom row; the min pathsums for these nodes are the values of the nodes themselves. From there, the min pathsum at the ith node on the kth row would be the lesser of the pathsums of its two children plus the value of itself, i.e.:

//minpath[k][i] = min( minpath[k+1][i], minpath[k+1][i+1]) + triangle[k][i];
//Or even better, since the row minpath[k+1] would be useless after minpath[k] is computed, we can simply set minpath as a 1D array, and iteratively update itself:

//For the kth level: minpath[i] = min( minpath[i], minpath[i+1]) + triangle[k][i]; 

    public int minimumTotal(List<List<Integer>> triangle) {
        if(triangle.size()==0)return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int level=triangle.size()-1;level>0;level--){
            for(int i=0;i<triangle.get(level).size()-1;i++){
                int currentmin;
        currentmin=(triangle.get(level).get(i)<triangle.get(level).get(i+1))?triangle.get(level).get(i):triangle.get(level).get(i+1);
        triangle.get(level-1).set(i,triangle.get(level-1).get(i)+currentmin);
            }
        }
        
   return triangle.get(0).get(0); }
}
