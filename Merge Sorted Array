Merge Sorted Array Total Accepted: 18096 Total Submissions: 56733 My Submissions
Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.

Note:
You may assume that A has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from B. The number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively.

public class Solution {
// work from backward, since you will rewrite the original array if work from front!!!
    public void merge(int A[], int m, int B[], int n) {//logic!!!
        int tail = m + n - 1;  
   --n; --m;  
   while (n >= 0) {  
     if (m <0 || A[m] <= B[n]) {  
       A[tail--] = B[n--];  
     } else {  
       A[tail--] = A[m--];  
     }  
   }  
 }  
}
