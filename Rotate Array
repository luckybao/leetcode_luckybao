Rotate Array Total Accepted: 30056 Total Submissions: 168675 My Submissions Question Solution 
Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.

For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].

Note:
Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.

Hint:
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

public class Solution {
    //rotate twice, first time, rotate the whole array, than rotate left and right
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n=nums.length;
        k%=n; //very important!!
        nums=helper(nums,0,n-1);
        nums=helper(nums,0,k-1);
        nums=helper(nums,k,n-1);
    }
    private int[] helper(int[] nums,int l,int r){
        
        if(l>=r)return nums;
        int temp;
        while(l<r){
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_swap_algorithm
            nums[l]^=nums[r];
            nums[r]=nums[l]^nums[r];
            nums[l]^=nums[r];
            l++;r--;
        }
    return nums;}
}
