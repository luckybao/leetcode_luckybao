House Robber Total Accepted: 19050 Total Submissions: 65941 My Submissions Question Solution 
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

public class Solution {//solution one
    //classic dp: dp[i]=max{dp[i-1],dp[i-2]+nums[i]}
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        int n=nums.length;
        if(n==1)return nums[0];
        if(n==0)return 0;
        int[] dp=new int[n+1];
        dp[0]=0;
        dp[1]=nums[0];
        for(int i=2;i<=n;i++){
            dp[i]=Math.max(dp[i-1],dp[i-2]+nums[i-1]);
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}

public class Solution {//solution two
    //classic dp: dp[i]=max{dp[i-1],dp[i-2]+nums[i]}, since it is one dimensional, it could be use O(1)space instead of O(n)
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        int n=nums.length;
        if(n==1)return nums[0];
        if(n==0)return 0;
        int a=0,b=nums[0],dp=b;
        for(int i=2;i<=n;i++){
            dp=Math.max(b,a+nums[i-1]);
            a=b;b=dp;
        }
        return dp;
    }
}
