Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock Total Accepted: 18555 Total Submissions: 59709 My Submissions
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
//logic: go through just once, the day will be either buy,sell or hold, be careful!!!
public class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {//this method is right on netbeans!
        if(prices.length==0||prices.length==1)return 0;
        int buy,i,sum=0;
        i=1;buy=prices[0];
        while(i<prices.length){
            if(prices[i]>buy){//sell day
                sum=Math.max(sum,prices[i]-buy);
            }else if(prices[i]<buy) buy=prices[i];
            i++;
        }
    return sum;}
}
