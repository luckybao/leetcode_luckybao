Number of 1 Bits Total Accepted: 10243 Total Submissions: 27591 My Submissions Question Solution 
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.

public class Solution {//solution 1, trick: n&(n-1), clear the last 1
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count=0;
       // int mask=1;
        while(n!=0){ 
            count++;
         n=n & (n-1);  
           
     }  
    return count;}
}
public class Solution {//solution 2, trick: total 32 bits
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count=0;
        int mask=1;
        for(int i=1;i<33;i++){
            if((n & mask)!=0){count++;}
            mask<<=1;
        }
    return count;}
}
