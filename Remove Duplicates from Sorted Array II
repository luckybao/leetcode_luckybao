Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II Total Accepted: 17734 Total Submissions: 57941 My Submissions
Follow up for "Remove Duplicates":
What if duplicates are allowed at most twice?

For example,
Given sorted array A = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

Your function should return length = 5, and A is now [1,1,2,2,3].

public class Solution {//we need to test the one that is two nodes away which is possible to have been overwritten which means we should test the two nodes that are supposed to be ahead of the current node in the new array
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] A) {
        if(A.length==0||A.length==1||A.length==2)return A.length;
        int count=0,i=2;
        for(i=2;i<A.length;i++){
            if(A[i]==A[i-count-1]&&A[i-count-1]==A[i-count-2])
            count++;
            else{A[i-count]=A[i];}
        }

    return A.length-count;}
}
