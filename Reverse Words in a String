return "blue is sky the".

click to show clarification.

Clarification:
What constitutes a word?
A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
Could the input string contain leading or trailing spaces?
Yes. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
How about multiple spaces between two words?
Reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.

public class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {//clean code,use string.split function
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) {
			return "";
		}
		String[] array = s.split(" ");//use string.split function
		StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
		for (int i = array.length - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
			if (!array[i].equals("")) {//if there are multiple spaces, there will be "", it should skip it move on!!!
				sb.append(array[i]);
				sb.append(" ");
			}
		}
		return sb.length() == 0 ? "" : sb.substring(0, sb.length() - 1);}
}
