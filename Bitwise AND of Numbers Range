Bitwise AND of Numbers Range Total Accepted: 11326 Total Submissions: 48990 My Submissions Question Solution 
Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

For example, given the range [5, 7], you should return 4.

public class Solution {
    //find common head of m and n
    //solution 1
    public int rangeBitwiseAnd(int m, int n) {
       if(n<m)return 0;
       while(n>m){n=n&(n-1);}//eliminate the last 1
       return m&n;}
}
