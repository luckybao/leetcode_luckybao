Factorial Trailing Zeroes Total Accepted: 16799 Total Submissions: 61026 My Submissions Question Solution 
Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Note: Your solution should be in logarithmic time complexity.

public class Solution {//solution one
    public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        if ( n<0 ) return -1;
        int count = 0;
        for (long i=5; n/i>=1; i*=5) {//need to be long!!! remember how to write for loop with i*=5
            count += n / i;
        }        
        return count;}
}

public class Solution {//solution two, prefered solution, use while loop, do not need to use long
    public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        if ( n<0 ) return -1;
        int count = 0;
        while(n>0){
            int next=n/5;
            count+=next;
            n=next;
        }        
        return count;}
}
